Assignment 2:

Cant go over the pixels using 1 image

New update to assignment 2 

If you have 2 images different sizes

Take the smaller image 


for(x: width)
  for(y: height)


{
Rb = 
Gb=
Bb=

2 dimension image stored in a 1 dimension array

If width %3 #4 is 0, there will be padding g

datasmall[XS, ys]

Function could be totally working, f(x1(wb1, ws)

X returned could be wrong, catch excess x with a condition 

R = A(1-t)+B*t
T \varepsilon[0,1]

Be careful about offset

BiLinear Interpolation

Line padding

Testing:

1. Mix lion & jar jar testing (no line padding, different sizes)
2. Mix anything with flowers
3. Implement BiLin


60% if your program works at least for images with different size but without line padding (e.g.
lion, jarjar).
25% if your program works for images with line padding (e.g. flowers)
25% if your program works with arbitrary resolutions and bilinear interpolation.

bilinear_interpolation -> linear interpolation in two dimensions

P(1) -> P(0.6)

? = 2/3 w_s -1/w_b -1

xs = x(ws_1/w_b-1)

0.0 = 1 2/3

i1 = (int)x_s
12 = i_1+1

dx = xs_(int)x_s // there must be float
